        <h2>We are a new club, established in 2024. Our club is based in Kungs√§ngen, Stockholm. </h2>
        <p>The motto of the club is to enjoy cricket at the fullest. Cricket has been a big part of our lives growing up. So, ending up in a country which is still not familiar with this beautiful game soon makes you homesick. 
        For us, cricket is not only a way of playing a sport on a weekend, but also a great medium to make friends in a new country. We try to enjoy our cricket to the fullest. Although we play to win, we make sure that we never miss the fun part of playing cricket
        while chasing victories. If you want to play cricket with us, get in contact. There is lots of cricket around Stockholm throughout the summer.</p>
